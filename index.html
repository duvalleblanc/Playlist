    <img src="images/richaxxhaitian.jpg" alt="richaxxhaitian cover" width="400" height="400">
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>This is currently my album of this year. When I first started the album I was immediately entranced by the intro.</p>
    <p>Mach-Hommy has consistently released albums that raise the bar on bars, flow, & rhyme schemes.</p>
    <p>The majority of the album being produced by SadhuGold adds to the misty foggy canvas he is rapping over.</p>
    <p>The stank face I had through this project was nonstop. The first time I heard the production for GORGON ZOE LAN...Wow</p>
    <p>This album is going down in my favorite albums of all time...Might Even be in the top 5 or 10 albums I have ever heard...</p>
    <p>The Insnae Features from Roc, YOD, Fahim, Black Thought.. all the way down to the Choir Singing in the Final Track "HOLY___"...</p> 
    <p>The album is nothing short of perfection.</p>
    <h4>Favorite Songs</h4>

    <h3> Roc Marciano - Marciology (2024)</h3>
    <img src="images/marciology.jpg.webp" alt="marciology cover" width="400" height="400">
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>This album is another work of art from Masterclass Rapper/Producer, Roc Marciano.</p>
    <p>The previous collab album with Producer/Rapper "The Alchemist", "The Elephant Man's Bones", in 2023, was</p>
    <p>such a dark, menancing, heavy collection of songs that I was interested if Roc would continue wit this sound.</p>
    <p>It was a pleasant surprise as going through this project that he went back to his soulful & minimalistic style of production.</p>

    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>The Alchemist is definitely a core Artist within the Underground.</p>
