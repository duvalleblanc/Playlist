    <h3>Westside Gunn - And Then You Pray For Me (2023)</h3>
    <img src="images/pray.webp" alt="pray cover" width="400" height="400">
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>It's always great to see how an artist can consistently deliver a product you enjoy but it still is served fresh.</p>
    <p>Westside Gunn is my favorite musical artist. He has consistently dropped albums that I enjoy and has always taken chances on music.</p>
    <p>This new album is definitely a new approach to the modern boom bap, minimalistic production he usually works with. This new</p>
    <p>album showcases a new addition to the typical Griselda sound, Trap beats and 808 drums. This album starts off with honestly is one</p>
    <p>of these greatest Westside Gunn verses I have ever heard. He definitely wanted to make a statement from the begininning with the Mamas</p>
    <p>Primetime verse. This is definitely my favroite song on this album and it tooks me about 20-30 minutes to actually move on to the next song</p>
    <p>on the album. I think this album is definitely going to cause some issues with the fans who only prefer boom bap production. This album</p>
    <p>will take a few more listens from people to get what he is doing with the blend of boom bap with 808 drums. The sound is still typical</p>
    <p>Griselda Production but is just an addition of 808 drums and modern artists like J.I.D. and Ty Dolla $ign. I really love this album</p>
    <p>and definitely think it is one of his best albums, not only in an artistic sense of creating a new canvas but re-inventing what has been done</p>
    <p>already. The more you listen to this album the more you will enjoy it. This is definitely lives up to the name of being a Luxury audio experience.</p>
    <p>The same way someone who was not into Westside Gunn and their ear (palette) for music at first told them that a Westside Gunn, Mach-Hommy,</p>
    <p>MF DOOM, Brownsville Ka, or anyone else in this Undergrond Modern Boom Bap scene...you had to become accustomed to the sound. This is just a new canvas.</p>

    <h3> Mach-Hommy - RICHAXXHATIAN (2024)</h3>
    <img src="images/richaxxhaitian.jpg" alt="richaxxhaitian cover" width="400" height="400">
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>This is currently my album of this year. When I first started the album I was immediately entranced by the intro.</p>
    <p>Mach-Hommy has consistently released albums that raise the bar on bars, flow, & rhyme schemes.</p>
    <p>The majority of the album being produced by SadhuGold adds to the misty foggy canvas he is rapping over.</p>
    <p>The stank face I had through this project was nonstop. The first time I heard the production for GORGON ZOE LAN...Wow</p>
    <p>This album is going down in my favorite albums of all time...Might Even be in the top 5 or 10 albums I have ever heard...</p>
    <p>The Insnae Features from Roc, YOD, Fahim, Black Thought.. all the way down to the Choir Singing in the Final Track "HOLY___"...</p> 
    <p>The album is nothing short of perfection.</p>

    <h3> Roc Marciano - Marciology (2024)</h3>
    <img src="images/marciology.jpg.webp" alt="marciology cover" width="400" height="400">
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>This album is another work of art from Masterclass Rapper/Producer, Roc Marciano.</p>
    <p>The previous collab album with Producer/Rapper "The Alchemist", "The Elephant Man's Bones", in 2023, was</p>
    <p>such a dark, menancing, heavy collection of songs that I was interested if Roc would continue wit this sound.</p>
    <p>It was a pleasant surprise as going through this project that he went back to his soulful & minimalistic style of production but</p>
    <p>with a touch of the dark spooky production. the intro song, Marciology, title track, pulls the listener into the dark abyss just like Rubber Hand Grip from</p>
    <p>The Elephant Man's Bones album. The intro is almost as if he is conjuring up a spell of dark matter that the listener is taking part in</p>
    <p>experiencing. The next song brings us back to the smooth minimal production with Goyard God. Lyrically this album is just such a continuous</p>
    <p>onslaught of murderous rhymes and internal rhymes. The production in True Love and Roc's lyrics is just such a perfection marriage of the two.</p>
    <p>By the time listener gets to Bebe's Kids it is just clearn that this guy is just on a different level. Roc is top 3 and my 2nd favorite Artist after Westside Gunn.</p>
    <p>Larry June begininning Bad Juju was a great way to relax the listener and allow the album to rest with his more slower paced and laid back vocal deliver.</p>
    <p>I don't want to review every single song so if you enjoy Roc Marciano and his music then this is a definitely MUST.</p>
    <h4>Favorite Songs</h4>

    <h3>Gangrene, The Alchemist & Oh No - Heads I Win, Tails You Lose (2024)</h3>
    <img src="images/heads.jpg.webp" alt="heads cover" width="400" height="400">
    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
    <p>The Alchemist is definitely a core Artist within the Underground.</p>
    <p>I can honestly say I had no idea Oh No was the younger brother of Madlib.</p>
