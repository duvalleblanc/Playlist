    <h1>Duval's Playlist</h1>

    <p> Welcome! This is my very first post.</p>
    <p>I will be posting Hip Hop Albums that I'm currently enjoying and give a brief description of each work.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this is to further my knowledge of learning Web Development but also tether it to a topic I enjoy.</p>
