# Albums
Underground Hip Hop Albums I am Enjoying.

The Idea of this Repo is just a place to put forth my thoughts on my favorite Underground Hip Hop Albums.
I want to incorporate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, & Javascript so that I can tether my learning to something that I generally discussing.

I currently will be using this as an ongoing project that will be updated consistently as I enjoy a new particular artist and or album.
This will allow my brain to develop the consistency of using Web Devlopment skills but also something I have an invested interest in.
